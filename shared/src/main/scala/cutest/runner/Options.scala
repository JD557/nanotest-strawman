/**
 * Configurable options for the runner.
 *
 * @param useSbtLogging specifies whether to use SBT's test-logging infrastructure,
 *        or just println.
 *
 *        Defaults to `println` because SBT's test logging doesn't seem to give us
 *        anything that we want, and does annoying things like making a left-hand
 *        gutter and buffering input by default.
 *
 *        Option inspired by its availability in uTest and other testing frameworks.
